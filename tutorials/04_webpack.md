# Webpack

Webpack is a module bundler for front-end technologies. It's an alternative to
using a complex gulpfile. So instead of making a complex gulpfile, you can set
up a complex webpack setup!

Gone are the days where you just make an html file, a css file, and a js file
and just connect them. It's an unfortunate side-effect of wanting to make things
more efficient at the same time that people want richer, interactive
online experiences.

Webpack has become one of the more popular build tools to compile react apps for
the web. It also has many good plugins that help you write modern javascript
that compiles to javascript that will work on a majority of browsers.

[Here][webpack] is the documentation for webpack. It's kind of hard to
understand the documentation if you don't already know how to setup webpack, so
we're going to make the simplest setup possible. Once you work through it, it
will make your development process much easier, especially as your app expands.
